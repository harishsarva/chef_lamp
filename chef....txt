Chef is a configuration management and automation platform from Opscode. Chef helps you describe your infrastructure with code. Because your infrastructure is managed with code, it can be automated, tested and reproduced with ease.
1.Installing Chef

2.Chef cookbook
So, what do we need to do to get our web server up and running?
Install and configure Apache
Install and configure MySQL
Install and configure PHP
Deploy our website code to the site
How do we do that? We write our first Chef cookbook. But before we do that we should setup a file structure that will help us organise our various Chef files. Opscode, the makers of Chef provide one. They call it simply the Chef Repository.

3.Resources
A resource is an action that your recipe can perform. The template resource creates a file by expanding variables in a template. The user resource can be used to manage users. The database cookbook provides the resource mysql_database which we will now use to perform the first step.
Open recipes/default.rb

4.Templates
WordPress keeps its configuration in a file called wp-config.php. We need to create that file and put database names and user access details inside it. Chef provides a resource called template that can do just that.
